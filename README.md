## M-expense App (Java)

The application that I developed is called M-Expense, it allows the staff to record trip details and expenses, and supports features such as adding, editing, deleting, taking photos, and search, ... to help employees manage cash flow, and trips in the easiest way. I have developed this project based on Java combined with firebase to backup data to the database.
